\begin{abstract}
  The Abstract paragraph should be indented 0.25 inch (1.5 picas) on
  both left and right-hand margins. Use 10~point type, with a vertical
  spacing of 11~points.  The {\bf Abstract} heading must be centered,
  bold, and in point size 12. Two line spaces precede the
  Abstract. The Abstract must be limited to one paragraph.
\end{abstract}

\section{GENERAL FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS}


Papers are in 2 columns with the overall line width of 6.75~inches (41~picas). Each column is 3.25~inches wide (19.5~picas).  The space
between the columns is .25~inches wide (1.5~picas).  The left margin is 1~inch (6~picas).  Use 10~point type with a vertical spacing of
11~points. Times Roman is the preferred typeface throughout.

Paper title is 16~point, caps/lc, bold, centered between 2~horizontal rules.  Top rule is 4~points thick and bottom rule is 1~point thick.
Allow 1/4~inch space above and below title to rules.

Author descriptions are center-justified, initial caps.  

One-half line space between paragraphs, with no indent.

\section{FIRST LEVEL HEADINGS}

First level headings are all caps, flush left, bold, and in point size
12. One line space before the first level heading and 1/2~line space
after the first level heading.

\subsection{Second Level Heading}

Second level headings are initial caps, flush left, bold, and in point
size 10. One line space before the second level heading and 1/2~line
space after the second level heading.

\subsubsection{Third Level Heading}

Third level headings are flush left, initial caps, bold, and in point
size 10. One line space before the third level heading and 1/2~line
space after the third level heading.

\paragraph{Fourth Level Heading}

Fourth level headings must be flush left, initial caps, bold, and
Roman type.  One line space before the fourth level heading, and
place the section text immediately after the heading with, no line
break, but an 11 point horizontal space.

\subsection{CITATIONS, FIGURES, REFERENCES}


\subsubsection{Citations in Text}

Citations within the text should include the author's last name and
year, e.g., (Cheesman, 1985). References should follow any style that
you are used to using, as long as their style is consistent throughout
the paper.  Be sure that the sentence reads correctly if the citation
is deleted: e.g., instead of ``As described by (Cheesman, 1985), we
first frobulate the widgets,'' write ``As described by Cheesman
(1985), we first frobulate the widgets.''  Be sure to avoid
accidentally disclosing author identities through citations.

\subsubsection{Footnotes}

Indicate footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first
  footnote.} in the text. Use 8 point type for footnotes. Place the
footnotes at the bottom of the column in which their markers appear,
continuing to the next column if required. Precede the footnote
section of a column with a 0.5 point horizontal rule 1~inch (6~picas)
long.\footnote{Sample of the second footnote.}

\subsubsection{Figures}

All artwork must be centered, neat, clean, and legible.  All lines
should be very dark for purposes of reproduction, and art work should
not be hand-drawn.  Figures may appear at the top of a column, at the
top of a page spanning multiple columns, inline within a column, or
with text wrapped around them, but the figure number and caption
always appear immediately below the figure.  Leave 2 line spaces
between the figure and the caption. The figure caption is initial caps
and each figure should be numbered consecutively.

Make sure that the figure caption does not get separated from the
figure. Leave extra white space at the bottom of the page rather than
splitting the figure and figure caption.
\begin{figure}[h]
\vspace{.3in}
\centerline{\fbox{This figure intentionally left non-blank}}
\vspace{.3in}
\caption{Sample Figure Caption}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Tables}

All tables must be centered, neat, clean, and legible. Do not use hand-drawn tables. Table number and title always appear above the table.
See Table~\ref{sample-table}.

One line space before the table title, one line space after the table title, and one line space after the table. The table title must be
initial caps and each table numbered consecutively.

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{Sample Table Title} \label{sample-table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
{\bf PART}  &{\bf DESCRIPTION} \\
\hline \\
Dendrite         &Input terminal \\
Axon             &Output terminal \\
Soma             &Cell body (contains cell nucleus) \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\subsubsection*{Acknowledgements}

Use unnumbered third level headings for the acknowledgements.  All
acknowledgements go at the end of the paper.  Be sure to omit any
identifying information in the initial double-blind submission!


\subsubsection*{References}

References follow the acknowledgements.  Use an unnumbered third level
heading for the references section.  Any choice of citation style is
acceptable as long as you are consistent.  Please use the same font
size for references as for the body of the paper---remember that
references do not count against your page length total.
